# Python Async Comprehension Project

## Description
This project contains Python scripts demonstrating the use of asynchronous generators and comprehensions.

## Content
| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [0-async_generator.py](0-async_generator.py) | Asynchronous generator |
| [1-async_comprehension.py](1-async_comprehension.py) | Asynchronous comprehension |
| [2-measure_runtime.py](2-measure_runtime.py) | Measure runtime |



## Files

1. **0-async_generator.py**
   - Contains an asynchronous generator that yields random numbers after a 1-second asynchronous delay.
   
2. **1-async_comprehension.py**
   - Implements a coroutine that uses async comprehensions to collect 10 random numbers asynchronously.

3. **2-measure_runtime.py**
   - Measures the total runtime for executing async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.

## Additional Requirements

- All files were interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All files were executed with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) and were checked for style using pep8 version 1.7.
